# WebGLProjects

Recently been getting back into JavaScript development. Haven't had a chance yet till now to learn about WebGL and its capabilities. I have been doing tutorials online and will be adding my creations to this repo in the near future.

- lesson one, 2d coloured triangle
- lesson two, 3d rotating cube (using three.js)
